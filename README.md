## 📁 Project Structure

```
cooklist-ai/
├── index.html          # Main HTML — all 4 screens (landing, form, loader, results)
├── style.css           # Complete "Air" design system + all component styles
├── app.js              # Constraint engine, recipe DB, form wizard, rendering
├── design.md           # "Air" style reference — tokens, typography, components
├── .gitignore          # Standard ignores (node_modules, .env, IDE files)
└── README.md           # You are here
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

The app is a single-page application with four screens, managed by a simple screen-swapping system:

```
┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Landing    │────▶│ Constraints  │────▶│   Loader     │────▶│   Results    │
│   (Hero)     │     │   (Form)     │     │ (Processing) │     │ (Dashboard)  │
└──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
                      3-step wizard        Terminal-style        Budget card
                      Budget/People        log animation         Meal cards
                      Diet/Time                                  Grocery list
                      Pantry tags                                Substitutions
```

### Constraint Engine

The meal planner uses a local recipe database (`RECIPES_DB`) with a constraint-matching algorithm:

1. **Filter** recipes by dietary preference and cooking time
2. **Select** one recipe per meal slot (breakfast, lunch, dinner) with random variety
3. **Diff** required ingredients against the user's pantry to build the grocery list
4. **Calculate** estimated cost with pantry discount (up to 70% savings)
5. **Generate** substitutions for missing ingredients from recipe metadata

No API calls — everything runs client-side for instant results.

## 🎨 Design System — "Air"

The visual identity follows the **Air** design system documented in [`design.md`](design.md):

- **Theme:** Light with sky canvas (`#426188`) background
- **Surfaces:** Progressive blur / glassmorphism via `backdrop-filter`
- **Accent:** Action Blue (`#1a6fe8`) for interactive elements only
- **Typography:** 4-font system — Inter (body), Oswald (display), Dancing Script (decorative), Space Mono (terminal)
- **Spacing:** 4px base unit, comfortable density
- **Elevation:** Minimal shadows, surface color differentiation + blur
